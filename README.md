# Consumer Mobility Dynamics

Paper 2: THE EFFECT OF CONSUMER MOBILITY AND E-WOM ON SALES

Abstract: This study examines the impact of consumer physical mobility on sales, considering electronic Word of Mouth (e-WOM) as a crucial moderator in this relationship. The research aims to: (1) analyze the direct effect of consumer mobility on sales; (2) explore how mentions on Twitter (X) can amplify or mitigate this relationship; and (3) assess the asymmetry between the effects of positive and negative e-WOM on sales. Employing a combination of spatial econometric models and machine learning techniques, the study seeks to uncover consumption dynamics, highlighting how e-WOM can either enhance the impact of physical mobility or restrict access to retail spaces, particularly in less accessible areas. The expected outcomes offer theoretical and practical insights for developing more inclusive marketing strategies that address accessibility challenges and promote economic growth in emerging markets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Tests

The algorithms and tests follow the logic below:
1) Upload databases (Base 1 'df', Base 2 'gdf', and Base 3 'sdf')
2) Codes:
   - Geospatial Analysis;
   - Feature Engineering;
   - Descriptive Statistics (demographic analyses);
   - Geospatial Data Integration;
   - Geospatial Data Visualization;
   - Interactive Map;
   - Correlation Tests (pearson);
3) ML Algorithms:
    * REGRESSION - SUPERVISED LEARNING
   - Linear Regression (Prediction of 'new_visits' based on the features: 'visits', 'unique', 'repeat_visitors', 'dwell_time_mins')
 4) Reference Model;
 5) Model Evaluation:
   - Mean Squared Error;
   - R¬≤;
   - Cross Validation;
 6) Learning Curve;
 7) Plots;
 8) Residual Analysis;
 9) Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling Test;
